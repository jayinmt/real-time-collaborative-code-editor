# Real-time Collaborative Code Editor

This project is a real-time collaborative code editor that allows multiple users to simultaneously edit and view the same code file in real-time. It uses JavaScript, web sockets, and real-time synchronization to create a seamless collaborative coding experience.

## Features

- Real-time collaboration: Users can join a shared coding session and see each other's changes in real-time.
- Syntax highlighting: The code editor supports syntax highlighting for JavaScript to enhance the coding experience.
- User presence: The application shows the cursor positions of all connected users in the code editor.
- Chat functionality: A chat feature is included to enable users to communicate with each other while collaborating on the code.
- User authentication: A simple user authentication system is implemented to identify and manage connected users.
- Version history: The application keeps track of code changes, allowing for potential implementation of viewing and reverting to previous versions of the code.

## Technologies and Libraries

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js and Express.js for the server-side implementation
- Socket.IO for real-time communication between the server and clients
- CodeMirror for the code editor component

## Getting Started

To run the collaborative code editor locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jayinmt/real-time-collaborative-code-editor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd real-time-collaborative-code-editor`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `node server.js`
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the collaborative code editor.

## Usage

1. Open the collaborative code editor in your web browser.
2. Authenticate yourself (authentication mechanism to be fully implemented).
3. Start coding in the code editor. Your changes will be synchronized in real-time with other connected users.
4. Use the chat functionality to communicate with other users while collaborating on the code.
5. Observe other users' cursor positions as they move through the code.

## Current Limitations and Upcoming Implementations

- Code execution is not yet implemented. The server includes a placeholder for this feature.
- User authentication is currently using a placeholder function. A proper authentication system needs to be implemented.
- The visual representation of other users' cursors is not yet implemented on the client-side.
- The version history feature is partially implemented on the server-side but not yet accessible through the UI.
